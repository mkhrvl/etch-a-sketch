# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

## Objective/s

This project looks to practice my knowledge mostly on JavaScript while refreshing some concepts from CSS that I have attained throughout the Odin Project's **[Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)**.

## Lessons Learned

- Start with small functions first then work your way up.
- If you're stuck with a part, go start working on another and get back to it another time.
- Explaining things to yourself can help you understand what you need to do.

## Things to Improve Upon

- Commit early and often, probably after every function or functions that works together.
- I can be quite stubborn when I get stuck.
